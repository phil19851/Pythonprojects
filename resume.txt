Significant Projects
Auto Routing of Helpdesk Tickets
Description : This project aimed to improve the ticket routing process by automating the categorization
and routing of support tickets based on their subject and description. It involved extracting data from
Service Now for closed tickets over an 18-month period. The project utilized the Random Forest algorithm
to analyze email information and mine the subject and description of the tickets to understand the
context of the calls. Based on this analysis and after performing data joins within master tables, the
algorithm accurately diverted the tickets to corresponding vendors. Only the segments of tickets with a
95% accuracy rate or higher were automatically routed, resulting in a 10% reduction in effort. Tickets
that did not meet the accuracy threshold were sent for manual review. This automated ticket routing
system streamlined the support ticket management process, optimizing efficiency and ensuring proper
ticket handling.

Customer : Largest Car Manufacturer in Europe
Tools used : Python,Natural Language Processing
Architecture : Artificial Neural Nets
Data-Driven Physician Loyalty Optimization in Healthcare
Description : This project involved defining the data requirements both externally and internally. The
focus was on understanding the HCUP database data and the internal database of inpatient records. A
key component was the scoring of physicians based on the percentage split across different service lines.
To predict physician loyalty based on past demand, predictive models such as Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were built. These models utilized the available data to make
accurate predictions. Overall, the project aimed to leverage data analysis and predictive modeling
techniques to gain insights into physician loyalty and optimize decision-making in healthcare operations.
